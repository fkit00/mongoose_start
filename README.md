# Monkeys & Mongoose

This is a repository for our database project: _Working Title In Progress_.

The goal of this project is to get some more experience with NoSQL databases, and specifically to work with MongoDB and Mongoose.

We're creating a database of different information about various primates, in honour of [Nathan's](https://github.com/N-LEE-94) deep love for orangutans. We're excited to help him achieve his lofty visions for this project, and to learn more together as a team along the way.

We're intending on seeing what we can do with MongoDB as our first goal, and the capabilities of it, and are currently working on setting up basic CRUD routes and a file structure etc. that follows best practices. After that, we'll be wireframing and planning a front-end, before building the MVP and hooking it all up.

This README will be updated as we get further into the project. For now, thanks for stopping by!
